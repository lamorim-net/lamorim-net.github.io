## My personal blueprint:

I've spent my career working in tech, leading marketing and product efforts, and building alongside ambitious people. Along the way, I've picked up some principles that guide how I think and work. This is my personal blueprint. It's not finished, but it keeps me grounded.

- Move fast: Speed shows what's working, removes blockers, and builds momentum that thinking alone can't. It forces clarity and accelerates learning.
- Learn always: Curiosity compounds. Every cycle of learning sharpens the next. Patterns matter more than answers, and questions matter most of all.
- Ignore titles: Real impact comes from ownership, not from standard labels. The best ideas often come from people no one expected.
- Embrace pressure: When the work feels heavy, it usually matters. Pressure is a sign of trust, and that's something to earn and honor.
- Ditch best practices: What's popular is usually outdated. I treat best practices as a floor, not a ceiling. Great work comes from first principles, not handbooks.
- Zoom in when it matters: Details are where quality lives. Knowing when to dive deep is a skill, not a habit. Small things often make the biggest difference.
- Play the long game: Quick wins fade. I build with time in mind. Strong teams, trusted products, and lasting impact all require patience.
- Find leverage: Effort alone doesn't scale. I look for tools, systems, and people that turn one unit of work into many units of output.
- Always invert: When things feel stuck, I flip them. Thinking backward about what to avoid often reveals the clearest path forward.
- Work with urgency: Stay present, avoid busy work, and move with purpose. Urgency doesn't mean rushing. It means caring enough to act now. Every second counts.
