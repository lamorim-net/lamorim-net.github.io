I'm a passionate product and advertising builder.

_Some things about me:_

- Grew up in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
- Live in Seattle, Washington, United States.
- Studying Economics at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/).
- Working with ads at [Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizamorim/) since 2016.

_Some things I believe:_

- **Move fast**: Speed shows what’s working, removes blockers, and builds momentum that thinking alone can’t.
- **Learn always**: Curiosity compounds. Every cycle makes the next one better.
- **Ignore titles**: Real impact comes from ownership, not from standard labels.
- **Embrace pressure**: If the work feels heavy, it probably matters. I want to be trusted with that.
- **Ditch best practices**: If everyone’s doing it, it’s probably safe and probably boring.
- **Zoom in when it matters**: Caring about the details means I care about the work.
- **Play the long game**: I build for the long run. Teams, trust, and great work get better over time.
- **Find leverage**: It’s not about hours. It’s about using tools, people, and ideas in smart ways.
